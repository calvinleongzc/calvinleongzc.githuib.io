<strong>Q: Why is the film only for those 21 and up?</strong><br><br>
<p>A: In line with IMDA’s Content Code for Video-on-Demand Services, we’ve self-regulated our film with an R21 rating, due to the presence of some mature themes. Hence, only those 21 and up will be eligible to attend the screenings for the film.</p><br><br>

<strong>Q: What are these mature themes?</strong>
<p>A: The following film contains some strong language. It also deals with mature themes, including but not limited to alcohol consumption, sexual activity and homosexuality. Though sensitive, we believe that it is important for us to reflect on how such themes are prevalent in real life, and how they can so easily affect our relationships with others. Spending time in solitude during this pandemic has given us more time and space to think critically about many issues, including how we treat others. We believe that now more than ever, we should not be shying away from such mature themes, and hope the film can trigger open and fruitful discussions.</p><br><br>

<strong>Q: Why must we pay $5?</strong>
<p>A: The IMDA Content Code states that content rated R21 cannot be offered to consumers for free. By collecting this small $5 fee we are able to ensure that each ticket purchase is legitimate.</p><br><br>

<strong>Q: So how do we register?</strong>
<p>A: When registering at the link provided, you will be prompted to submit a photo of valid identification and a screenshot proving your payment. Once your age and payment have both been verified, we will contact you with a unique password to access the screening. More details can be found at the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ttaks">registration link</a>.</p><br><br>

<strong>Q: I’ve registered. How can I watch the film?</strong>
<p>A: The Truth About Keeping Secrets will premiere at 8pm on 18 December 2020. Those who are successfully registered will be notified via email just before the premiere, and provided with their unique password to access the film. They can then input their password at the <a href="watch.html">Watch page</a> to watch the film as many times as they wish. The Truth About Keeping Secrets will be live for 48 hours, before going offline at 8pm on 20 December 2020.</p>
